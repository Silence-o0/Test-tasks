This repository contains solutions for 2 tasks:
1. Image classification + OOP (Classifying images on the MNIST dataset using 3 different algorithms: Random Forest, Feed-Forward Neural Network, Convolutional Neural Network).
2. Named entity recognition + image classification (Checking whether the text provided by the user contains an animal name that matches the image also provided by the user).

Each folder has its own README.md, where you can find detailed information about each task.
